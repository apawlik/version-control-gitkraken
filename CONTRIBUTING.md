If you want to want to contribute to the NeSI documentation and training material, you can do so in many ways:
* via this repository, making a Pull Request or pushing directly (if you have permissions)
* [opening an issue]()


Please note, all material is organised in lessons (in the `_lesson` folder and then relevant sub-folders) and written in GitHub flavoured Markdown. When contributing, please use this structure and formatting.
