# What is version control

Version control is a piece of software which helps you manage efficiently and effortlessly versions of your code and other text files, including some data files (e.g. in `csv` format). Version control provides a well-design mechanism to support collaboration when writing code. 

*The brief introduction to the benefits of version control below comes from the* [excellent lesson on Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) by [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/)


* Nothing that is committed to version control is ever lost, unless you work really, really hard at it. Since all old versions of files are saved, it’s always possible to go back in time to see exactly who wrote what on a particular day, or what version of a program was used to generate a particular set of results.

* As we have this record of who made what changes when, we know who to ask if we have questions later on, and, if needed, revert to a previous version, much like the “undo” feature in an editor.

* When several people collaborate in the same project, it’s possible to accidentally overlook or overwrite someone’s changes. The version control system automatically notifies users whenever there’s a conflict between one person’s work and another’s.

Teams are not the only ones to benefit from version control: lone researchers can benefit immensely. Keeping a record of what was changed, when, and why is extremely useful for all researchers if they ever need to come back to the project later on (e.g., a year later, when memory has faded).

Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world: it’s what professionals use to keep track of what they’ve done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. And it isn’t just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.


# Setup

In this tutorial we will use [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) to work with Git version control. GitKraken provides a Graphical User Interface to Git (which in its default "shape" is a command line tool).

We use [GitHub](http://github.com/) for learning how to use the remote repositories.
